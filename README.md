# Knotes-Central 📚

A one stop site for all your notes in RV College of Engineering.
Yes we could not find our engineering notes 1 day before exams (duh !). To overcome this skill issue, we are gonna do a classic engineer move.

We are making a website where students can access all the notes for all the subjects in the college. (Provided someone among students has uploaded the notes)

## Why Knotes-Central? 🤔

- Because searching for notes at 11 PM before exam is our cardio 🏃‍♂️
- Your WhatsApp is already full of memes, no space for PDFs
- Google Drive links expire faster than our motivation to study
- That one friend who has all the notes is probably sleeping (how dare they!)

## Features 🌟

- Awesome Notes Dump (because we know you're procrastinating)
- Search functionality (unlike that mess in your backpack)
- Subject-wise organization (yes, we're more organized than your life)
- Mobile-friendly (study from anywhere, even during those boring family functions)
- Dark mode (because your future is already bright enough)

## How to Contribute 🤝

1. Upload your notes (yes, those scribbles are welcome too)
2. Share with your friends (spread knowledge, not rumors)
3. Star this repo (it's free, just like our advice)

## Coming Soon 🚀

- PDF previews (so you know what you're not going to read)
- Rating system (rate notes, not your crush)

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This project was born out of pure desperation and too much caffeine. Any resemblance to actual organization is purely coincidental.

Remember: Sharing notes won't make you fail, but not having them definitely might!

## Tech Stack 💻

Built with:

- Love ❤️
- Panic 😱
- Coffee ☕
- And oh yeah, some actual code too...

Made with 💖 by students who understand the struggle is real.

P.S.: If you're reading this the night before your exam, good luck! You'll need it. 🍀
